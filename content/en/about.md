Hello! My name is **Demétrio**, but some people call me _Demi_ or _Deme_. I’ve been
designing, developing, and maintaining software since 2010. Currently, I focus on
building scalable streaming solutions.

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and board games—especially those that
offer a good strategic challenge. Some of my favorites are
[The White Castle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/371942/the-white-castle) and
[Everdell](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell), but I’m always eager
to try new games. I’m also passionate about great stories, whether they come from
books, comics, or manga.

Lately, I’ve been exploring 3D printing—creating game pieces and other creative
projects. And when I want to relax, I usually listen to music or play a bit of guitar
just for fun.

I’m a Christian, and my faith plays an important role in my life, guiding my values
and daily actions.

This blog is a place where I share insights, experiences, and reflections on my
journey in technology—and beyond. Feel free to explore the content and join the
conversation!
